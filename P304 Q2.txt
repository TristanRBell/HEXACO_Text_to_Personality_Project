So we had.
00:00:01 Speaker 1
A pretty important strategy decision to make on the direction of a particular product that had been out in the market for a while, but we needed to decide whether we would keep it compatible with previous versions, which would actually hold back our innovation and you know, prevent us from.
00:00:20 Speaker 1
Getting new customers so well or to basically make a break.
00:00:25 Speaker 1
And you know, potentially lose some old customers, but open ourselves up to new markets and and really grow our business. So it was a risky decision. You know, one way or the other, we were not going to make some people happy. We're going to make some people unhappy. And, you know, it was it was difficult. So.
00:00:45 Speaker 1
I made sure I you know, I had my opinion. But you know, we all collaborate together. I talked with existing customers and tried to figure.
00:00:54 Speaker 1
Out a way that we could.
00:00:57 Speaker 1
Is the problem of them being, you know, essentially left behind is there? Is there a way that we could help them to migrate to the new version quicker while still you know?
00:01:07 Speaker 1
You know great division triggers which will allow us to go on the side of innovation and you know I think do think we made the right decision.

And then on the other hand, we did grow our new customer base by over 100%.
00:01:27 Speaker 1
So I'm pretty happy that that it was the right decision.
