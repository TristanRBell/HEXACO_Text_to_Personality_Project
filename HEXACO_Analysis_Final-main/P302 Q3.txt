So I would refer back to the example I gave in the first question, where I assumed the lead role in designing this pretty critical education for a key product rollout. I volunteered for it. I thought it was a good project for me. I thought I had the skills and I thought it was also stretched myself.

00:01:27 Speaker 1
Something good and I think that we all pretty much stretched ourselves and achieved way more than together, achieve more together than we would have done as individuals. And I don't think you can ask for more than that as a team leader.
