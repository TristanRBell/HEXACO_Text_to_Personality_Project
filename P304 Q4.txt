This doesn't happen that often, especially in my current role. I you know, it can happen occasionally, just maybe in the the heat of a meeting.
00:00:14 Speaker 1
And let's just say that there's a it's a lively discussion happening and I might throw out an idea, but maybe it kind of gets lost in the the background chatter or I don't speak loud enough or maybe it's not quite in the right context. So I think the important thing is not to take things personally.
00:00:34 Speaker 1
It's.
00:00:35 Speaker 1
It does happen, but it's fairly rare that someone is deliberately trying to squash your ideas.

It's better to just try to do it calmly and make sure it's in the right context and then at least you'll find out. Was it something that was just passed over by mistake, or is it a real deliberate?
00:01:45 Speaker 1
Flight and then you need to take different action in that case.
